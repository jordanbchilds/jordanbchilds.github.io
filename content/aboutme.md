I'm currently a statistics PhD student at Newcastle University. My project is focused on Bayesian data analysis and stochastic modelling, applied to mitochondrial disease. In general I am interested in anything in these areas; Bayesian statistics, stochastic modelling and reducing their computational cost.

I plan on (sporadically) writing blog posts in these areas. In general these will be in two streams "something interesting" or "something helpful", hopefully they will live up to their names. Given the subject area it is likely the posts will involve some kind of coding in the post which I plan on making all available through GitHub with links provided when required. My programming language of choice is R, C++ or Julia depending on the situation. So these are the ones to expect. I am however keen to begin learning functional programming, so there may be some Haskell or Scala in the future.
