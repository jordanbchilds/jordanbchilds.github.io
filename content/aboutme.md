I'm currently a statistics PhD student at Newcastle University, where I also completed an integrated masters in Mathematics and statistics and postgraduate diploma in Cloud Computing for Big Data. My project is focused on Bayesian data analysis and stochastic modelling, applied to mitochondrial disease. In general I am interested in anything in these areas; Bayesian statistics, stochastic modelling and reducing their computational cost.
