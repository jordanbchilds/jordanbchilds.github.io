This may be particularly useful in areas of stochastic modelling and Monte Carlo simulation, where repeated and independent simulations are required to learn about uncertainty in model predictions. The chip in question is called the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) and is developed by Graphcore, a UK-based company headquartered in Bristol.</description>
